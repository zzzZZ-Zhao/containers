# Workflomics - domain and tool descriptions

This repository contains the domain and tool descriptions needed to generate and execute workflows in the [Workflomics](https://github.com/Workflomics/workflomics-frontend) interface.

To add new domains or tools to the `Workflomics` environment, CWL files and other files needed to run these tools should be added to this repository. See the [domain annotation guide](https://workflomics.readthedocs.io/en/domain-creation/developer-guide/domain-development.html) for more information.

The repository is organized in the following way:

- `domains/`: Contains the domain descriptions. The descriptions are used by the Workflomics environment to generate workflows. Each domain comprises a set of tools (e.g., described in `tools.json` file) and a configuraion file (e.g., `config.json`) that specifies the domain-specific parameters. See the [documentation of the APE engine](https://ape-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/specifications/setup.html#configuration-file) to learn more about the configuration file.
- `cwl-tools/`: Contains the CWL CommandLineTool descriptions of the tools used in the workflows (similar to the [bio-cwl-tools](https://github.com/common-workflow-library/bio-cwl-tools) repo). The CWL files are used by the Workflomics environment to execute each step of the workflow. Within the Workflomics ecosystem these workflows are executed using the [Workflomics Benchmarker](https://github.com/Workflomics/workflomics-benchmarker) which utilizes [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool).
- `examples/`: Contains example workflows that can be executed using the [Workflomics Benchmarker](https://github.com/Workflomics/workflomics-benchmarker). The workflows were generated by the Workflomics platform are written in the [Common Workflow Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/).

When using Workflomics web interface, workflows are referencing this repository directly. They are downloaded during the workflow execution, so you don't need to clone this repository for normal usage in the Workflomics environment.
